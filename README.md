# PyCharm loses commit info if git hook fails

PyCharm (and probably another IDEA-based IDEs as well)
doesn't preserve Git commit info, such as:
* commit message;
* selected files/lines;

if Git hooks fail and interrupt commit. It's really
annoying if you first make many changes and then try
to make your commits granular, or if you write long
descriptive commit message, and then you lose it all
because of one of the Git hooks failed.

## Steps to reproduce

0. Clone this repo;

0. Create always failing Git hook:

    ```shell script
    cat <<EOT >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
    echo "Fail!"
    false
    EOT
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

0. Configure remote task server in your IDE (Settings > Tools > Tasks > Servers):
    * Add GitHub repo as remote task server;

0. Start task:
    * Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Open Task...
    * Choose "Test issue: add your name and fix typos"

0. Try changing two different files: `1.txt` and `2.txt`;

0. Open "Commit Changes" window (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K);

0. Type some commit message (overwrite default one), add one file to commit but don't add another;

0. "Run Git hooks" option should be enabled;

0. Commit it, it will fail;

0. Open "Commit Changes" window again;

0. Where is your changes (message, selected files)? Everything was reset to default values.
